# Code

Here is some example code snippets.

 - `Manipulating_tuples.ipynb` is an example of using `uproot` and `pandas` to open a `ROOT` file, and a new variable to the tree and then write it to a new file.
 - `Unfolding.ipynb` gives a simple demonstration of using `pyunfold` to undo detector effects - taken from the tutorial here [https://jrbourbeau.github.io/pyunfold/api.html](https://jrbourbeau.github.io/pyunfold/api.html)
 - `CorrectedMassFit.ipynb` is a corrected mass template fit using `cabinetry` and `pyhf`. It uses the configuration defined in `config.yaml`
